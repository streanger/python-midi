FOR NOW IT'S IN RUBBISH WAY, BUT WORKS (TESTED WITH ALL CONNECTIONS, NOT WITH REAL KEYBOARD)

Setup for using atmega32 in arduino ide:
    1. do this stuff (http://openhardware.ro/using-atmega32-arduino-ide/):
            Download project https://github.com/eaconner/ATmega32-Arduino/archive/master.zip or ATmega32-Arduino-master.
            Locate file boards.txt in arduino folder  …arduino-1.5.2\hardware\arduino\avr\boards.txt
            Append information from zip archive boards.txt to original boards.txt
            Make a folder named mega32 in …arduino-1.5.2\hardware\arduino\avr\variants
            Copy file pins_arduino.h from the zip into folder created at step 4.
            
    2. compile your sketch with using arduino ide; upload stuff with using avrdude:
        -path with compiled file: C:\Users\quiter\AppData\Local\Temp\arduino_build_625088
        
        avrdude -c stk500v1 -p m32 -Pcom8 -b19200 -U flash:w:m32_test.ino.hex
        
        
    3. fix some errors (https://www.instructables.com/id/Using-Atmega32-with-Arduino-IDE/):
        change this (in pins_arduino.h):
            const static uint8_t SDA = 8; //wrong
            const static uint8_t SCL = 9; //wrong
        to:
            const static uint8_t SDA = 17; //correct
            const static uint8_t SCL = 16; //correct
            
        UPDATE:

        For Serial library to work properly must be made following changes to the file HardwareSerial.cpp
        In ...\arduino-1.5.8\hardware\arduino\avr\cores\arduino\HardwareSerial.cpp

        will replace:

        #if defined(__AVR_ATmega8__)
            config |= 0x80; // select UCSRC register (shared with UBRRH) 
        #endif
        with:

        #if defined(__AVR_ATmega8__) || defined(__AVR_ATmega32__) || defined(__AVR_ATmega16__)
            config |= 0x80; // select UCSRC register (shared with UBRRH) 
        #endif

        
    4. my problem for now --> https://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=336196.0
        -hardware serial on atmega32 works fine
        -software serial is not needed, but midi_controller library needs it
        -to fix it quick, we just need to comment softwareserial part in mido_controller library
        
    
    
    
    5. After upload sketch to atmega32, we need to connect two keyboards via pcb, supply atmega32 and use FTDI, to get data to PC
    
    6. Handle MIDI commands with using some desktop app (can use python_mido_uart.py)
