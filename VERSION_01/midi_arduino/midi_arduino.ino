/*
This is an example of the "ButtonMatrix" class of the MIDI_controller library.
Connect a 4 Ã— 3 matrix of buttons with the rows to pins 2, 3, 4 and 5, 
and the columns to pins 6, 7 and 8.
Pull-up resistors are not necessary, because the internal ones will be used. 

If you want to be able to press multiple buttons at once, add a diode 
in series with each button, as shown in the schematic on the Wiki:
https://github.com/tttapa/MIDI_controller/wiki/Hardware

The note numbers are specified in the 'addresses' array.
Map accordingly in your DAW or DJ software.

// INFO --> for now there are lines to be used: 2, 13, and 0, 1, where on 1, data are transmited(MIDI OUT), and on 0, data are received(not used in real). Which means we have 3 lines, to use, but we need 4, to control full keyboard :(

/***** IMPORTANT THING *****
 * 
maybe it should be some change in ButtonMatrix.cpp library, in line 44:

it should be:
  uint8_t note = addresses[row][col];
instead of:
  uint8_t note = addresses[col][row];

I need to tnink for a while if this is possible to change it with using prepared functions
